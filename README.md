# optimimzationAnalyzer
Helps analyze pulp optimization problems

The idea is to make it easy to debug optimization problems using the PuLP library. If we think about variables being associated to constraints with coefficients, and constraints being associated to variabled, there is a natural representation using a pandas dataframe.
